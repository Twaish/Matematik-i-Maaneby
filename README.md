# Måneby Preservation Project

Unprotected files for educational game Matematik i Maaneby by Bitfrost Interactive I/S and later associated with **Darkhill Games**. The game was built using **Macromedia Director** and distributed as a standalone Shockwave projector executable.

## 🧩 Opening the Project

To explore the game's structure and logic:

1. Open **Macromedia Director 8.5** or a compatible version.
2. Use `File > Open` to load any of the unprotected `.dir` files from this repository.
3. You can browse the movie timeline, inspect cast members, and read or edit the original Lingo scripts.

> [!WARNING]  
> Ensure the included `Xtras/` folder is accessible from Director’s search path for full functionality (e.g., Buddy API, FileXtra4).
